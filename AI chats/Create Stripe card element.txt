Question:
Using this doc https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-js/react create a CardElement and wrap it into HOC to handle Stripe API errors

Answer:
I'm sorry, but as a text-based AI developed by OpenAI, I can't directly access or browse external webpages or databases like Stripe documentation at https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-js/react. However, I can still help you generate an example code snippet based on my training data.

To create a CardElement and wrap it into a Higher Order Component (HOC) to handle Stripe API errors, we'll first need to install the necessary Stripe React library, `@stripe/react-stripe-js`. This is in addition to the regular Stripe JS library, `@stripe/stripe-js`. In your project directory, run:

```
npm install @stripe/react-stripe-js @stripe/stripe-js
```

Now we can use these libraries to create our CardElement and HOC. Here's an example of how you might do this:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { CardElement, useStripe, useElements } from '@stripe/react-stripe-js';

// 1. Create a basic CardElement component
function CardComponent() {
    const stripe = useStripe();
    const elements = useElements();

    const handleSubmit = async (event) => {
        event.preventDefault();

        if (!stripe || !elements) {
            // Stripe.js has not loaded yet. Make sure to disable form submission until Stripe.js has loaded.
            return;
        }

        const card = elements.getElement(CardElement);

        const {error, paymentMethod} = await stripe.createPaymentMethod({
            type: 'card',
            card: card,
        });

        if (error) {
            console.log('[error]', error);
        } else {
            console.log('[PaymentMethod]', paymentMethod);
        }
    };

    return (
        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
            <CardElement />
            <button type="submit" disabled={!stripe}>Pay</button>
        </form>
    );
}

// 2. Create a HOC to handle Stripe API errors
const withStripeErrorHandling = WrappedComponent => {
    return class extends React.Component {
        componentDidCatch(error, info) {
            if(error.type === 'StripeError') {
                // handle Stripe errors here
                console.log('Caught a Stripe error: ', error.message);
            } else {
                // handle other errors normally
                super.componentDidCatch(error, info);
            }
        }

        render() {
            return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;
        }
    }
};

// 3. Wrap our CardComponent in the HOC
const CardComponentWithErrorHandling = withStripeErrorHandling(CardComponent);

export default CardComponentWithErrorHandling;
```

This code creates a basic `CardComponent` that uses the `useStripe` and `useElements` hooks from the `@stripe/react-stripe-js` library to create a payment method when a form is submitted. If there are any errors during this process, they are logged to the console.

The `withStripeErrorHandling` function is a Higher Order Component (HOC) that wraps another component and adds error handling functionality to it. This HOC checks if an error is a Stripe error, and if so, it logs a special message to the console. Otherwise, it lets the error propagate normally.

The `CardComponent` is then wrapped in the `withStripeErrorHandling` HOC, creating a new component, `CardComponentWithErrorHandling`, that includes the original functionality of `CardComponent` plus the added error handling of the HOC. This wrapped component is then exported for use elsewhere in your app.

Remember, this is just a basic example and may not cover all edge cases or specifics of your application. You'll need to adjust it to fit your exact needs, including how you want to handle Stripe errors and what you want to do when a payment method is successfully created.

Question:
Using this doc https://stripe.com/docs/elements/appearance-api add an appearance to the CardElement

Answer:
Although I can't directly access or browse external webpages such as the Stripe documentation, based on my training data, I can give you an example of how to add appearance styles to the `CardElement`.

Stripe's appearance API allows you to adjust the look and feel of your CardElement by passing a `style` object to your `CardElement`. Here's an example:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { CardElement } from '@stripe/react-stripe-js';

function CardComponent() {
    const CARD_OPTIONS = {
        style: {
            base: {
                color: "#32325d",
                fontFamily: 'Arial, sans-serif',
                fontSmoothing: "antialiased",
                fontSize: "16px",
                "::placeholder": {
                    color: "#aab7c4"
                }
            },
            invalid: {
                color: "#fa755a",
                iconColor: "#fa755a"
            }
        }
    };

    return (
        <div className="CardElement">
            <CardElement options={CARD_OPTIONS} />
        </div>
    );
}

export default CardComponent;
```

In this example, the `CardElement` has a base style that's applied in normal state, which includes specific font and color settings. The `::placeholder` key defines the style of placeholder text in the CardElement. When the card information is invalid, it changes the color of text and icon to `#fa755a`.

These styles are then passed to `CardElement` as a part of the options prop.

The options you can use to style your element may have changed or increased, so you should check the most up-to-date Stripe documentation to ensure you're using the correct style properties.

Remember that the appearance you want to add to your CardElement depends on your specific design needs and can vary greatly from this example.
